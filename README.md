# üí´ About Me:
I am a senior technical writer and content strategist with over 10 years of experience transforming complex technologies into clear, practical content. My background includes:
- Documentation and Content Design ‚Äì API documentation, platform guides, BPM and integration tools, and release notes.
- Video and Training ‚Äì Product demos, simulations, onboarding materials, and technical enablement resources.
- Collaboration ‚Äì Working closely with developers, SMEs, and product teams to make technical knowledge accessible.
I have contributed to projects across iPaaS, BPM, mainframe integration, and utilities domains. On GitHub, I focus on:
- Exploring AI-driven documentation and automation.
- Sharing learning resources and templates for writers and teams.
- Experimenting with content and code workflows, including docs-as-code and CI/CD for knowledge.

Currently, I am exploring how AI can accelerate documentation processes while maintaining accuracy and trust. I am also expanding my knowledge of APIs, cloud platforms, and integration technologies to strengthen my technical foundation
